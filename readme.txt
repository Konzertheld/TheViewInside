[README BETA]
TheViewInside - theme for Habari 0.7 and 0.8

INSTALLATION
Upload the entire folder "theviewinside" into the themes folder in your user folder. Log in as admin, go to the themes admin page and activate the new theme. Done.

SUPPORTED STUFF
- comes with a template for events and an eventlist. Get the eventscontent plugin to use them.
- integrates with PicasaSilo (see features)

AREAS
- The headerbar is created as an area so you can put your blocks there.

FEATURES
- Posts can have images next to the content. You have various options to use that feature. The easiest way is to write your post as always and then activate the "Extract images" box in the TheViewInside settings container, which is added to your publish page after the theme installation. There you can also remove the images (they will not really be removed from the database, only from the output) if you don't want them to be displayed twice.
- Another option is to fill in the two new text fields. Those two options can be used together.
- A third option is to have an image in your user files folder, named slug-vertikal.png where slug is your post's slug.
- Sidecontent images may have a maximum width of 146px to be inside the content column or a maximum width of 220px to overlap the content column. Higher widths will be reduced and will only slow down the page loading.
- When you have a PicasaSilo gallery in your post, TheViewInside will automatically get it, put some photos on the side and add a link to the full gallery.
